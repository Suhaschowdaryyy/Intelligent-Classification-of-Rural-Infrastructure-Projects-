Intelligent-Classification-of-Rural-Infrastructure-Projects-


The Intelligent Classification of Rural Infrastructure Projects aims to automate the categorization of road and bridge construction projects under the Pradhan Mantri Gram Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) and its sub-schemes (PMGSY-I, PMGSY-II, RCPLWEA, etc.). Traditionally, classification of these projects has been carried out manually, which is time-consuming, error-prone, and difficult to scale given the large volume of ongoing and completed projects across India.

This project leverages IBM Cloud Lite services to design, build, and deploy a machine learning model that classifies projects into their correct PMGSY scheme based on their physical and financial attributes.
